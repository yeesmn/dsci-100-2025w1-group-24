    "For this project, I am using two datasets collected from a Minecraft research server. Since my project focuses on identifying which kinds of players contribute the most gameplay data, the sessions dataset plays a central role. A single player may appear many times in session data, so I computed the total play time for each player by adding the duration of all their sessions. After creating this aggregated measure, I identified the top 20 players with the highest total play time. These players are used to check whether characteristics such as experience, age, or gender are associated with being a heavy contributor."
